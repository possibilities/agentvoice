# @agentchats/transcript 0.3.1

Packed from [agentchats main e6bea54](https://github.com/possibilities/agentchats/commit/e6bea54),
based on the requested `e973c55` foundation. MIT license is inside the archive.
Consumer fixes and shared features landed upstream:

- `94e45fc`: optional message timestamps; unknown native times render without a clock.
- `40ac3f3`: scoped transcript root flex sizing in a column host, with overflow/follow regression coverage.
- `338789f`: follows updates while near the bottom, counts new messages while reading earlier text,
  and supplies the shared jump-to-latest chip; corrects packaged transcript canvas styling.
- `b77c32c`: standalone Agent composer with queue/steer/interrupt affordances and awaited
  queue editing; omits the follow chip in empty and non-overflowing transcripts.
- `2eb84b4`: readable Codex voice handoffs with original-content disclosures, wider
  columns and tighter spacing, complete tool details, and composer label/focus polish.
- `e6bea54`: larger monospaced reading and composer text, an 80ch prose cap inside
  the 1120px outer column, compact gaps and at least 44px composer touch controls.

Reproduce from that clean agentchats revision:

```sh
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix web run build:package
